I started BK a few years ago but only made it about a third
into the book. Some differences based on what I can recall:

- The portion of BK I read was entirely centered around a
  single family --- the Karamazovs. Anna Karenina moves back
  and forth between several groups of people. It has many 
  central characters but two "main" characters, who aren't
  related by blood, and who rarely cross paths.

- AK presents to the reader a much richer depiction 
  of the social/cultural and political issues prevalent in 
  late 19th century Russia than BK. I recall the latter 
  seeming like a story that could relatively easily be transplanted
  to another country, and perhaps another time. I suppose in 
  principle AK could be transplanted in such a way, but 
  it would mean having to rethink the motivations and 
  concerns of many of the characters in massive ways. 
  There are long discussions in AK concerning, for instance,
  the value of the Zemstvo institutions in Russia. One of the 
  main characters is trying fitfully throughout the story
  to work out his ideas on the moral and economic problems 
  troubling relations betweeen Russian peasants and landowners. 
  AK is really a kind of educational primer on that place 
  and time. That may sound kind of tedious but Tolstoy 
  has a way of occupying the reader's attention with these 
  issues without allowing the book to ever devolve into some
  dry would-be Platonic dialogue. Those issues are just 
  "in the air" at the same time as all the emotionally 
  gripping dramatic events are taking place. It adds to the
  intense realism of the storytelling and makes the world
  of the characters deep and convincing, just as 
  when a good sci-fi story feels like it takes place
  in a "lived in" world.

- BK seems more to make Christianity a major theme than AK.
  Religion does come to the fore at different times in AK,
  and there is one character whose agnosticism is a 
  recurring theme, but insofar as AK touches on philosophical 
  themes, it is more purely existential. Characters grapple with 
  what it means to achieve earthly happiness, particularly 
  with whether love and family are its essence, and wrestle 
  with the feeling that life is meaningless or deeply unfair, 
  but don't really spend a lot of time brooding specifically 
  on the meaning of Christianity (or lack thereof). That 
  said, Christian faith and its ties to humility, suffering, 
  and forgiveness do come into focus in poignant ways.

- Tolstoy's style is less dialogic when compared to 
  Dostoevsky's. Tolstoy seems to me to do a better, more 
  realistic job of depicting the physical details of 
  scenes and characters. Conversations involve far less
  extended monologue. Tolstoy uses internal monologue 
  brilliantly. His deft way of presenting his characters' 
  thoughts concisely and convincingly is one of the major 
  joys of the book. At times this internal monologuing 
  approaches stream-of-consciousness style---fifty or so 
  years ahead of Joyce---as characters' 
  thinking mingles "in real time" with their reactions to
  events taking place in their surroundings.

- One of the major themes of AK is infidelity. In part the
  book is a deep dive into the costs and rewards 
  of being unfaithful to a loveless marriage for the 
  sake of genuine love, or what at least presents itself 
  as genuine love. A lot of those costs seem specific to the 
  legal and societal strictures binding marriage and divorce
  in 19th century Russia, but others are more universal.
  BK doesn't touch on that topic at all, as far as I know. 
  AK, unlike BK, is a genuine and at times quite 
  passionate "forbidden love" story.
